            <h2>CLOUD COMPUTING, AUTONOMIC COMPUTING, COMPUTER VISSION</h2>
            <p>a means of networking remote
                servers that are hosted on the
                Internet. Rather than storing
                and processing data on a local
                server, or a PC’s hard drive.</p>
            <p>Cloud is a model of computing where servers,
                networks, storage, development tools, and even
                applications (apps) are enabled through the internet.</p>
            <p><strong>TYPES OF CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE</strong></p>
            <p> Public Cloud

                Connecting to a public cloud means using an internet
                connection to access computing resources hosted on data
                centers managed by a third-party cloud service provider,
                
                rather than owning and maintaining these resources on-
                premise. A shared public cloud has many organizations (or
                
                tenants) sharing the same infrastructure.</p>
            <p> Private Cloud

                This cloud model is great for organizations concerned about
                sharing resources on a public cloud. It is implemented on
                servers owned and maintained by the organization and
                accessed over the internet or through a private internal
                network.</p>
            <p> Hybrid Cloud
                Combination of public cloud and private
                cloud, frequently in combination with some
                on-premise infrastructure. It could also
                combine a public cloud with another public
                cloud (multicloud).</p>
            <p><strong>QUANTUM COMPUTING</strong></p>
            <p>A multidisciplinary field comprising aspects of computer
                science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum
                mechanics to solve complex problems faster than on
                classical computers.</p>
            <p><strong>AUTONOMIC COMPUTING</strong></p>
            <p>A computer’s ability to manage itself automatically through
                adaptive technologies that further computing capabilities and
                cut down on the time required by computer professionals to
                resolve system difficulties and other maintenance such as
                software updates.</p>
            <p><strong>CHARACTERISTICS OF AUTONOMIC COMPUTING</strong></p>
            <p>Self-Configuring- A autonomic system with self-configuring properties can
                automatically configure and reconfigure accordingly to adapt
                itself to unpredictable changes.</p>
            <p>Self-Healing-Delivers resiliency by detecting, prohibiting disruptions and
                recovering from malfunctions where the affected systems are
                able to recover without losing data or delay in operational
                process.</p>
            <p>Self Optimizing-Able to provide continuous monitoring and adjust its
                resources and operations where the system will repetitively
                optimize its operation according to a set of prioritized
                nonfunctional requirements to adapt the dynamically changing
                environment of application.</p>
            <p>Self-protecting- capable in securing information and resources from
                attacks and threats by using pattern recognition method
                or other vulnerabilities analysis techniques and
                applications.</p>
            <p><strong>COMPUTER VISION</strong></p>
            <p>It is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how
                computers can be made to gain a high-level understanding of
                digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it
                seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.</p>
