            <h2>Internet of Things</h2>
            <p>The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active  engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below• AI − IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it enhances every aspect of life  with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks. This can mean something  as simple as enhancing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect when milk and your favorite cereal run low,  and to then place an order with your preferred grocery.</p>
            <p>• Connectivity:New enabling technologies for networking and specifically IoT networking, mean  networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks can exist on a much smaller and  cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates these small networks between its system devices</p>
            <p>• Sensors: IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments that  transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable of real-world  integration. </p>
            <p>• Active Engagement: Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens through  passive engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product, or service engagement</p>
            <p>• Small Devices: Devices, as predicted, have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful over  time. IoT exploits purpose-built small devices to deliver its precision, scalability, and versatility.</p>
            <p><strong>What is IoT? </strong></p>
            <p>The description of the Internet of Things is related to different definitions used by several groups  for promoting the particular concept in the whole world. </p>
            <p>➢ According to the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) definition, IoT is the networking of smart  objects, meaning a huge number of devices intelligently communicating in the presence of internet protocol  that cannot be directly operated by human beings but exist as components in buildings, vehicles or the  environment.</p>
            <p>➢ According to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) organization’s definition, IoT is the  networking of smart objects in which smart objects have some constraints such as limited bandwidth,  power, and processing accessibility for achieving interoperability among smart objects.</p>
            <p>➢ According to the IEEE Communications category magazine’s definition, IoT is a framework of  all things that have a representation in the presence of the internet in such a way that new applications and  services enable the interaction in the physical and virtual world in the form of Machine-to-Machine (M2M)  communication in the cloud.</p>
            <p>➢ According to the Oxford dictionary’s definition, IoT is the interaction of everyday object’s  computing devices through the Internet that enables the sending and receiving of useful data. ➢ The term Internet of Things (IoT) according to the 2020 conceptual framework is expressed  through a simple formula such as: IoT= Services+ Data+ Networks + Sensors </p>
            <p>Generally, The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded  with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and  exchange data. IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects,  animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network  without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. IoT is a network of devices that can  sense, accumulate and transfer data over the internet without any human intervention.</p>
            <p>Simply stated, the Internet of Things consists of any device with an on/off switch connected to the  Internet. This includes almost anything you can think of, ranging from cellphones to building maintenance  to the jet engine of an airplane. Medical devices, such as a heart monitor implant or a biochip transponder  in a farm animal, can transfer data over a network and are members of the IoT. If it has an off/on the switch,  then it can, theoretically, be part of the system. The IoT consists of a gigantic network of internet-connected  “things” and devices. Ring, a doorbell that links to your smartphone, provides an excellent example of a  recent addition to the Internet of Things.  </p>

            <p><strong>Internet of Things- Advantages</strong></p>
            <p>The advantages of IoT span across every area of lifestyle and business. Here is a list of some of the  advantages that IoT has to offer:  </p>
            <p>• Improved Customer Engagement: Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and significant  flaws inaccuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely transforms this to achieve  richer and more effective engagement with audiences.</p>
            <p>• Technology Optimization: The same technologies and data which improve the customer  experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology. IoT unlocks a  world of critical functional and field data. </p>
            <p>• Reduced Waste: IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us superficial  insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to the more effective management of resources.</p>
            <p>. • Enhanced Data Collection: Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its design  for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces and places it exactly where humans really want to go to  analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything. </p>
            <p><strong>Intenet of Things-Disadvantages</strong></p>
            <p>Here is a list of some of the disadvantages of IoT. these are: </p>
            <p>• As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices,  the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases. </p>
            <p>• If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted. • Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from  different manufacturers to communicate with each other. </p>
            <p>• Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers maybe even millions of IoT  devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging. </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges of IoT</strong></p>
            <p>Though IoT delivers an impressive set of advantages, it also presents a significant set of challenges.  Here is a list of some its major issues: </p>
            <p>• Security − IoT creates an ecosystem of constantly connected devices communicating over  networks. The system offers little control despite any security measures. This leaves users exposed to  various kinds of attackers.</p>
            <p>• Privacy − The sophistication of IoT provides substantial personal data in extreme detail without  the user's active participation. </p>
            <p>• Complexity − Some find IoT systems complicated in terms of design, deployment, and  maintenance given their use of multiple technologies and a large set of new enabling technologies</p> 
            <p>. • Flexibility − Many are concerned about the flexibility of an IoT system to integrate easily with  another. They worry about finding themselves with several conflicting or locking systems</p>
            <p>. • Compliance − IoT, like any other technology in the realm of business, must comply  withregulations. Its complexity makes the issue of compliance seem incredibly challenging when many  consider standard software compliance a battle. </p>
            <p><strong>HISTORY OF IOT</strong></p>
            <p>The Internet of Things has not been around for very long. However, there have been visions of  machines communicating with one another since the early 1800s. Machines have been providing direct  communications since the telegraph (the first landline) was developed in the 1830s and 1840s. Described  as “wireless telegraphy,” the first radio voice transmission took place on June 3, 1900, providing another  necessary component for developing the Internet of Things. The development of computers began in the  1950s. </p>
            <p>The Internet, itself a significant component of the IoT, started out as part of DARPA (Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1962 and evolved into ARPANET in 1969. In the 1980s,  commercial service providers began supporting public use of ARPANET, allowing it to evolve into our  modern Internet. Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) became a reality in early 1993, with the Department  of Defense providing a stable, highly functional system of 24 satellites. This was quickly followed by privately owned, commercial satellites being placed in orbit. Satellites and landlines provide basic  communications for much of the IoT. One additional and important component in developing a functional  IoT was IPV6’s remarkably intelligent decision to increase address space.  </p>
            <p>The Internet of Things, as a concept, wasn’t officially named until 1999. One of the first examples  of an Internet of Things is from the early 1980s and was a Coca Cola machine, located at the Carnegie  Melon University. Local programmers would connect by the Internet to the refrigerated appliance, and  check to see if there was a drink available and if it was cold, before making the trip. </p>
            <p>By the year 2013, the Internet of Things had evolved into a system using multiple technologies,  ranging from the Internet to wireless communication and from micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)  to embedded systems. The traditional fields of automation (including the automation of buildings and  homes), wireless sensor networks, GPS, control systems, and others, all support the IoT. </p>
            <p>Kevin Ashton, the Executive Director of Auto-ID Labs at MIT, was the first to describe the Internet  of Things, during his 1999 speech. Kevin Ashton stated that Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) was a  prerequisite for the Internet of Things. He concluded if all devices were “tagged,” computers could manage,  track, and inventory them. To some extent, the tagging of things has been achieved through technologies  such as digital watermarking, barcodes, and QR codes.  
                Inventory control is one of the more obvious advantages of the Internet of Things.</p>
