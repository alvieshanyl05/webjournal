      <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence.
        Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", or “the ability to learn and solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power."</p>

      <h3>Internet of Things</h3>
      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnected network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. IoT allows for the seamless collection and exchange of data, enabling a more automated and efficient world.</p>

      <h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
      <p>The fundamental idea of AR is to combine, or mix, the view of the real environment with additional, virtual content that is presented through computer graphics. Its convincing effect is achieved by ensuring that the virtual content is aligned and registered with the real objects. As a person moves in an environment and their perspective view of real objects changes, the virtual content should also be presented from the same perspective. Augmented reality (AR) is a form of emerging technology that allows users to overlay computer generated content in the real world. AR refers to a live view of a physical real-world environment whose elements are merged with augmented computer-generated images creating a mixed reality.</p>

      <h3>Data Science</h3>
      <p>	Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. Data science is much more than simply analyzing data. It offers a range of roles and requires a range of skills. </p>

      <h3>Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, & Block Chain</h3>
      <p><strong>Nanotechnology</strong></p>
      <p>Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering</p>
      <p><strong>Biotechnology</strong></p>
      <p>Biotechnology is technology based on biology - biotechnology harnesses cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies and products that help improve our lives and the health of our planet. We have used the biological processes of microorganisms for more than 6,000 years to make useful food products, such as bread and cheese, and to preserve dairy products.</p>
      <p><strong>Block Chain</strong></p>
      <p>A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).</p>

      <h3>Cloud and Quantum Computing</h3>
      <p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></p>
      <p>A means of networking remote servers that are hosted on the Internet. Rather than storing and processing data on a local server, or a PC’s hard drive.</p>
      <p><strong>Quantum Computing</strong></p>
      <p>A multidisciplinary field comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than on classical computers.</p>

      <h3>Embedded System, Additive Manufacturing and Cyber Security</h3>
      <p><strong>Embedded System</strong></p>
      <p>It is a controller with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured are used in embedded systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Additive Manufacturing</strong></p>
      <p>“Additive manufacturing” (AM) is a big-picture term more at home in the boardroom than the factory floor or garage. Naturally, AM separates itself from older, subtractive technologies like milling. Otherwise, the term is less about the 3D printer itself, and more about the manufacturing process transformed by 3D printing.</p>
      <p><strong>Cyber Security</strong></p>
      <p>It is the protection of computer systems from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.</p>
